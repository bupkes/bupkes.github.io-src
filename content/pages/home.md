Title: About Me

My name is [Matt]("https://wyrd.systems"){class="h-card"}.

I live in Sussex in the UK. I'm a dad and a husband.

For fun I solve cryptic crosswords, usually with [Rachel](https://twitter.com/archelina). As well as just doing them on paper, we also run [a weekly group solve every Sunday on Twitch](http://twitch.tv/CrypticSunday).

I enjoy coding. I'm very much an amateur but I find it quite satisfying. I like coding with HTML and Python best. I've made this site myself, for example.

At work I help people learn how to use their technology. For the last ten years or so I've worked with people who are blind or partially-sighted.
